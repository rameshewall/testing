If they aren’t already installed, add the following to /etc/apt/sources.list
deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ lucid multiverse
deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ lucid multiverse
deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ lucid-updates multiverse
deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ lucid-updates multiverse
Then, install some required libraries

apt-get update
apt-get install java-package
apt-get install sun-java6-jdk
apt-get install sun-java6-jre
apt-get install ant
apt-get install subversion

Now, download and install Red5
wget http://www.red5.org/downloads/red5/1_0_1/red5-1.0.1.tar.gz
tar xvfz red5-0.9.1.tar.gz
mv red5-0.9.1 red5
mv red5 /usr/share/

Let’s try running it now:
cd /usr/share/red5
sh red5.sh


Now try going to http://your-server-address:5080 in a web-browser.
